# Options page success feedback

## Summary
Provide visible, non-intrusive feedback on save/delete actions in Options to help users understand that actions succeeded.

## Scope
- Add a small status toast/snackbar or inline message on profile add, edit, and delete.
- Auto-dismiss after a short delay; accessible text for screen readers.
- No external libraries; simple CSS/JS implementation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Feedback appears on add/edit/delete and disappears automatically.
- No overlap with modals; does not block interaction.

## Risks
Low; UI-only change.
